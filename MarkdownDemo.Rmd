# My First knitr document

## Introduction

**Markdown** is a very basic and easy-to-use syntax for styling written documents. It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to FCSIT](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my)!

**Here is a code chunk and it prints the code and result.**

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

*Here is a code chunk but it only print the result.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Here is a code chunk but it doesn't print anything!!!

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Inline text computation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
time <-format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

### The current time is `r time`.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Add another R code chunk for a different plot:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(plotrix)
slices <- data.frame(Numbers = c(10,35,18,8,3), 
                     Status = c("Professors","Associate Professors","Senior Lecturers","Lecturers","Tutors"))
fan.plot(slices$Numbers, labels = paste(slices$Status, slices$Numbers, sep = " - "), 
         main = "Fan Plot - Number of Academician by Status")

```

Add image:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://keukenhof.nl/wp-content/uploads/park74-720x405-c-default.jpg")
```
